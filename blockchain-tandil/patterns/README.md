# Ethereum patterns

This is a list of patters from differnt places

## Introduction

First,  rather  unconventionalprogramming paradigms are required, because of the inherentcharacteristics  of  blockchain-based  program  execution.  Forexample,  programmers  have  to  consider  the  lack  of  execu-tion  control  and  the  immutable  character  of  smart  contractsonce  they  are  deployed.  Second,  due  to  missing  low-levelprogramming abstractions the developer is responsible for theinternal  organization  and  manipulation  of  data  at  a  deeperlevel.  Third,  the  rapid  transformation  of  platform  featuresand  security  considerations  requires  continuous  awareness  ofplatform capabilities and potential security risks.
