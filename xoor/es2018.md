# ES2018 (ES9)

ECMAScript 2018 was released in June 2018, adds fewer features than major editions (ES2016, ES2017) used to.
These new changes are Asynchronous Iteration, Rest/Spread Properties, new features to Regular Expressions and a revision to template literals.

## Asynchronous Iteration

With synchronous iteratinos, we are able to iterate data from a synchronous source, but not when data is from an asynchronous source, for example https fetch.

We will recap synchronous iteration and then asynchronous iteration.

### Synchronous iteration

Synchronous iteration was introduced with ES6 and have the following components

* **Iterable**: Is an object that can be iterated via a method with key `Symbol.iterator`
* **Iterator**: An object returned by `[Symbol.iterator]()`. It has a method `.next()` that returns the next element.
* **NextElement**: Is the object returned by `.next()` that has 2 properties:
  * **value**: Contains the value to be used.
  * **done**: Is a boolean that becomes true after the last element.

If you need some extra info about Iterator pattern. Check this [link](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/iterator)

### Asynchronous Iteration

The previously explained way of iterating is synchronous, it doesn‚Äôt work for asynchronous sources. For example, in the following code, `fetchCoinValues()` can't deliver its asynchronous data via synchronous iteration:

```javaScript
for (const coinValue of fetchCoinValues(['ETH','XMR','BTC','LTC','BAT'])) {
  console.log(coinValue);
}
```
ES2018 specifies a new protocol for async iteration:

* Async iterables are marked via `Symbol.asyncIterator`.
* Method `.next()` of an async iterator returns a `Promise` or `NextElement`.

With this new protocol, we are able to `await` for an asynchronous fetched `coinValue`

```javascript
for await (const coinValue of fetchCoinValues(['ETH','XMR','BTC','LTC','BAT'])) {
  console.log(coinValue);
}
```    
## Rest/Spread Properties 

We have a new (or two) operator(s). 
* The rest operator(`...`) is used in object destructuring.
* The spread operator(`...`) in object literals.

(Yes, looks similar =))
### Rest operator

Inside object destructuring patterns, the rest operator (`...`) copies all enumerable own properties of the destructuring source (`foo`) into its operand( `const { }`), **except** those that were already mentioned in the object literal.

```javascript
const foo = {
  empandas: 6,
  milanesas: 2,
  yerba: "1 Kg",
};

const { yerba, ...rest } = foo;

console.log(yerba); // Prints "1 Kg"
console.log(rest); // Prints {empandas: 6, milanesas: 2}
```

We can do it inside of a function, to handle named parameters
```javascript
function func({yerba, ...rest}) { // rest operator
  /** 
  * You can eat empanadas and drink mate here using property rest.empanadas 
  * and rest.yerba.
  */
};
```

We can use the rest operator at most once and it must be last.

```javascript
const  { ...rest, yerba } = foo; // syntax error, must be last.
const  { ...rest, ...others } = foo; // syntax error, 2 operators.
```

### Spread operator

In rigth side object literals (`{...foo, water: "1 L"}`), the spread operator (`...`) inserts all enumerable own properties of its operand (`foo`) into the object created (`bar`) via the literal:

```javascript
const foo = {
  empandas: 6,
  milanesas: 2,
  yerba: "1 Kg",
};

const bar = { ...foo, water: "1 L"  };

console.log(bar); // Prints 
/**
* {
*   emapnadas: 6,
*   milanesas: 2,
*   yerba: "1 Kg",
*   water: "1 L",
**/
```
If we have conflicts with keys (`empandas`), last one wins (`empanadas : 12`). This is useful to override default keys.

```javascript
const foo = {
  empandas: 6,
  milanesas: 2,
  yerba: "1 Kg",
};

const bar = { ...foo, empanadas: 12  };

console.log(bar); // Prints 
/**
* {
*   emapnadas: 12,
*   milanesas: 2,
*   yerba: "1 Kg",
**/
```

## New features related to regular expression

This release brings 4 new features to regulars expressions

### Flag /s (dotAll)

Dot (`.`) in regular expressions don't match line terminators

```javascript
console.log(/^.$/.test('\n')) // Prints false
```

DotAll flag (`/s`) allows `.` in a regExp to match line terminators ( `/n`) and emojis (`üòÅ`)

```javascript
console.log(/^.$/s.test('üòÅ')); // Prints true
```

### Unicode Property Escapes

Unicode standard assings properties to each symbol, like `White_Space`. Now, we can access this properties inside of RegEXp using flag `/u`.


```javascript
const result = /^\p{White_Space}+$/u.test('3 empanadas');

console.log(result) // Prints true
```

This new feature makes RegExp much more readeables. 

### Lookbehind Assertions 

A lookbehind assertion is denoted by `?<=`, and enables you to match a pattern based on the substring that precedes the pattern. For example,

```javascript
const regExp = /(?<=\$|¬£|‚Ç¨)\d+(\.\d*)?/;

console.log(regExp.exec('199')); // Prints null
console.log(regExp.exec('$199')[0]); // Prints 199
```

Also, we have the negative version replacing `=` with `!`, that is `?<!`

```javascript
const negativeRegExp = /(?<!\$|¬£|‚Ç¨)\d+(\.\d*)?/;

```

Remember that the substring matched by the lookbehind expression isn't captured and isn't part of the result.

### Named capture groups

Named capture groups enable you to take apart a string with a regular expression.

Matching a regular expression returns an object. If a fragment of the regular expression is inside a parentheses, is a capture group and it's stored in the matched object.

Prior to ES2018, all capture groups were indexed by indexes

```javascript
const eventDate = /([0-9]{4})-([0-9]{2})-([0-9]{2})/;

const matchedObject = eventDate.exec('2019-04-03');
console.log(matchedObject[1]); // 2019
console.log(matchedObject[2]); // 04
console.log(matchedObject[3]); // 23
```

After this update, we can name groups `year, month and day` using `<groupName>`, that are stored inside `groups` key:

```javascript
const eventDate = /(?<year>[0-9]{4})-(?<month>[0-9]{2})-(?<day>[0-9]{2})/;

const matchedObject = eventDate.exec('2019-04-03');
console.log(matchedObject.groups.year); // Prints 2019
console.log(matchedObject.groups.month); // Prints 04
console.log(matchedObject.groups.day); // Prints 03
```
We can combine with destructuring!

```javascript
const { groups: {day, month} } = matchedObject.exec('2019-04-03');

console.log(day); // Prints 03
```

With this update is easier to find groups by ID(year, month, day), each group is self descriptive.

## Promise .finally

ES2018 introduces a new callback that is always executed, no matter if then or catch is called.

```javascript
fetch(url)
  .then()
  .catch()
  .finally(() => console.log(`I'm always called!`));
```

`.finally` is useful when you need to do some clean up after the operation has finished regardless of whether or not it succeeded,for example to close a connection. 

## Template literal revision

When a template literal (`${food} is tasty`) is immediately preceded by an expression (`fn '${food} is tasty'`), it is called a tagged template literal. A tagged template comes in handy when you want to parse a template literal with a function(`fn`). Consider:

```javascript
function fn(string, substitute) {
  if(substitute === 'empanadas') {
    substitute = 'milanesas with mashed potatoes';
  }
  return substitute + string[1];
}

const food = 'empanadas';
const result = fn(`${food} are tasty!`);

console.log(result); // Prints milanesas with mashed potatoes are tasty!
```

It has problems with escape sequences like hex (`\x`), unicode (`\u`), or octal (`\` followed by a digit). Strings like `C:\xxx` or `\ubuntu` are considered invalid escape sequences and throws a SyntaxError.

With ES2018 revision, each illegal sequence is undefined

 ```javascript
 function fn(string, substitute) {
  console.log(substitute); // Prints escape sequences:
  console.log(string[1]); // Prints undefined
}

const str = 'escape sequences:';
const result = fn`${str} \ubuntu C:\xxx\uuu`;
```

Keep in mind that using illegal escape sequences in a regular template literal still causes an error:

```javascript
const result = `\ubuntu`; // SyntaxError: Invalid Unicode escape sequence
```

## Conclusions

This is a lot to digest, but each word, revision, feature and release will improve or programming skills.
Remeber that, having this in mind,*and using it*, our code will be **shorter** and **cleaner** than before.
